# Physical Activity Analysis: Project Overview

In this analysis, we will be exploring data from the Physical Activity and Transit Survey (PAT). It is a survey conducted by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in 2010-2011 consisting of 2 major parts: a telephone survey of physical activity and health (N=3811) and a weeklong accelerometer device study (N=679) . Note: A sub-sample of participants of the phone survey participated in the accelerometer study.

## This analysis consists of several parts:

- Select a subset of features, based on presense of NaNs, multicollinearity, and gaunged significance.
- Perform correlation analysis between them to gain insight about health, habits, and physical activity 
- Select a subset of the previous feature set, and perform cluster analysis using the K means and Gaussian Mixture Model algorithms to 
  better understand the patterns in the data.
